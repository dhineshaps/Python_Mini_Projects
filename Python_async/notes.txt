Async lib is used to write concurrent code.

Sync code - one thing happening to another. - subway store model - 
one person sandwhich is made before going to next person

Concurrent code - more than 1 happening at the same time - like noraml resturant - 
one takes the order things will happen at backend meanwhile another order will be taken irrespective of first order deliver.
